Models and migrations seem logical to us

We would have expected two-way creation of "deliveries," i.e. carrier can initiate delivery and sender can also initiate delivery

Search function to find people with similar routes (e.g. sender can search carriers)

Broken link? Creating a recipient

Creating a delivery seems to cause dollar amount to become 10x the entered amount?
